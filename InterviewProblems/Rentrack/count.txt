This is some text for the Rentrack test. The idea is to count the
number of times the work 'Rentrack' appears in a file. Here is the
original problem description:

Write a program that, given a file name, returns the number of times
the work 'Rentrack' appears in the named file.

Here is a line with the work Rentrack multiple times:

Rentrack, Rentrack, fred, stuff, garbage, Rentrack, Hi!, Rentrack
Start of line: Rentrack, Rentrack.

And, in conclusion, Rentrack.
