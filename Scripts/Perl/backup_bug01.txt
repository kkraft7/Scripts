#
# This bug occurred when the "TD" directory was missing from one file set and
# the "OD" directory was missing from another. The first file set was correctly
# skipped, but the second file set was processed despite the missing file
# (the contents of "OR" were copied to "TD").
#
# This bug was fixed by changing $var = "" to undef($var), which caused the
# "if undef()" test guarding the main loop to work correctly.
