To-Do:

* Remove Scripts/NCAA.old (after checking/comparing contents)?
* Look into what to do about GitHub security alerts

Notes:

* To push changes do: 
* Not sure why listApp and MPGCalculator are listed as "untracked"
  when they already map to git repos

For the NCAA stuff the actual repo (where I do development and updates)
is /home/Kevin/Scripts/NCAA. Any updates need to be copied from there
to Scripts\NCAA for check-in.

Local folders representing individual repositories:

listApp (maps to listApp)
listApp/client (maps to listAppClient)
MPGCalculator (maps to ragazziMpg)

Local repos/Folders combined with Scripts:

JavaTestClasses
JavaTutorials
VMWare

Git repos not mapped locally on my PC:

demo_app (Ruby on rails tutorial)
first_app (Ruby on rails tutorial)
sample_app (Ruby on rails tutorial)
